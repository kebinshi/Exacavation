{"name":"Excavator Minecraft","tagline":"A Minecraft Project","body":"## Welcome to Excavator Minecraft.\r\nThis is the wikipedia for Excavator Minecraft server. Excavator Minecraft is a server entrenched in pre-historic times. You have been born as a slave and your goal is to work your way up the life classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Items\r\n### Bio-Fossils\r\nBio-Fossils are dropped when excavating a mining zone. Different blocks have different tendencies of dropping Bio-Fossils. Bio-Fossils can be sold in the Black Market for extra gold.\r\n\r\nBio-Fossils Drop Rate is affected by enchantment \"Luck\".\r\n\r\n    Sand (id: 12): 10% Bio-Fossil Drop Rate \r\n    Red Sand (id: 12:1): 15% Bio-Fossil Drop Rate\r\n\r\n### Custom Lores\r\nOn certain items, there will be custom lores to facilitate the story line of the server. These lores do not affect the gameplay and damage values of the item.\r\n \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Enchantments\r\n### Luck\r\nLuck is an enchantment derived from Looting in vanilla Minecraft. When a player uses a tool with the enchantment \"Luck\", the drop rates for items are increased by percentages (e.g 5% increase). \r\n\r\nHighest level of enchantment \"Luck\" is 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mining Zones\r\n### Crystal Desert\r\nA large desert covering the spans of the horizons, large diamond crystals protruding through the sands is only a small fraction of the riches hidden beneath.  Giant bones of the ancient beasts are common.\r\n\r\n### Red Mesa\r\nStreams flow down to the river from the mesa, but only shrubs and cacti are able to survive in this region.\r\n\r\n### Volcanic Wasteland\r\n### Volcano\r\nThick smoke rises from the volcano's crater, and streams of lava flow out from the sides onto the ocean water. Large basalt columns protrude around the volcano, and large stone spires rise up from the adjoining landscape. Although rocky, there is also unique life on the volcano not found anywhere on the island, thanks to the volcanic soil produced by the ashes.\r\n\r\n### Mountain Peak\r\nThe mountain peaks soar beyond the thick clouds, populated by huangshan pines. Several large stone pillars dot the edges of the peak, and a large ridge to the north is the only landform dividing the mountains from the rice terraces. \r\n\r\n### Lush Forest\r\nThe region is difficult to traverse due to its large cliffs, but at the same time beautiful waterfalls can be seen cascading down them - when the view is not covered by the large trees, of course. \r\n\r\n### Bamboo Forest\r\nGiant bamboo stalks jut out from the forest floor, and the rest of the landscape is covered by a canopy of large green and crimson trees. However, it is not just the land that is brimming with life - off the coast of the bamboo forest, clumps of bamboo thrive in both shallow and deep waters, accompanied by large waterlilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nExcavator Minecraft would not be possible without the works of the following authors. \r\n\r\n1.
